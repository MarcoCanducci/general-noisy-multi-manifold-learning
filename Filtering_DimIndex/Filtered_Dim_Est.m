%   Description
%
%   Input parameters:
%       -   Data_Original: Data not yet processed using SAF.
%       -   Data: Matrix Nx3 containing the observed points in a 3D space.
%                 N is the number of observations, 3 is the dimensionality 
%                 of the embedding space.
%       -   Radius: Radius for the neighbouring search.
%
%   Output parameters:
%       -   LNew: Matrix containing eigenvalues associated to each  
%           obs' neighbourhood, renormalized by their sum. 
%       -   NewLabels: Logic array containing "1" for the valid obs and
%           "0" for the rejected ones.
%       -   NewData: Matrix containing the valid obs of which a
%           dimensionality index has been found.
%       -   idx: column vector with dimensionality index for each valid
%           observation.
%       -   C: 3x3 matrix with the new centres after kmedoids.
%       -   DistM: N_Valid_obs x 3 matrix with the distances of each valid
%           obs to the initial clustering centres.
%   
%   LNew = Dim_Est_New(Data,Radius) gives the matrix containing the
%       renormalized eigenvectors.
%   [LNew,NewLabels] = Dim_Est_New(Data,Radius) also returns the labels
%       for the selection of valid obs;
%   [LNew,NewLabels,NewData] = Dim_Est_New(Data,Radius) also returns the
%       valid obs
%   [LNew,NewLabels,NewData, idx] = Dim_Est_New(Data,Radius) returns the
%       dimensionality index associated to each obs in Data.
%   [LNew,NewLabels,NewData, idx, C] = Dim_Est_New(Data,Radius) gives the
%       centres after the clustering through k-medoids is performed.
%   [LNew,NewLabels,NewData, idx, C, DistM] = Dim_Est_New(Data,Radius)
%       returns the matrix with all distances of the obs to the centres as
%       computed with FisherMetricDist.
%
%   For each obs in Data, the covariance matrix of its neighbourhood is
%   decomposed into its eigenvalues. These get then normalized by their sum,
%   so that each triade of eigenvalues lies on a portion of the
%   3d-simplex. A further step is applied for distributing the eigenvalues
%   in the complete simplex ([1 0 0, 0 1 0; 0 0 1]) so that the its mean is
%   equidistant from each vertex and coincides with the point [1/3 1/3
%   1/3]. Here probabilities vary between [0 1] for each one of the
%   dimensions. The distance of each triade of new rescaled eigenva√≤ues
%   to the vertices is computed and stored in DistM, while the MATLAB
%   implementation of the algorithm k-medoids is used for clustering obs
%   with respect to the centres (used as clusters' prototypes).
